# Project Proposal - Darren Liu
## Background Story

Nowadays, because of the COVID situation, used cars are getting more and more expensive.
People are usually confused if they should get a car now or if they should wait. Hence,
more and more people need a car price predicting tool to predict the price of used cars
to avoid spending too much money.

## Data discription

The data I need for the model will be collected by scraping cars.com, where I can get
the car's price, year, model, milage, engine and so on. Each row will represent a car's
information. The data will be divide into two parts: training data and testing data. The
training data will be used to train the model and the testing data will be used to test
the accuracy.

## Tools
I'll be using Chrome to better understand the website that I'm going to scrape, and Python
packages like statsmodels and BeautifulSoup for regression calculation, matplotlib, pandas for vitualization
and data cleaning. 

## MVP goal
My MVP goal would be scraping and cleaning the data from cars.com, and show some vitualization
of the data and the model.
