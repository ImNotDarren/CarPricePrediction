## Web scraping
I scraped [cars.com](https://www.cars.com) by writing
[this](/web_scraping.ipynb) to retreive car information
and saved them in a [csv file](/data/car_info.csv).

## modeling
The modeling part is done in [this file](/car_price_prediction.ipynb).
I have the data cleaned and have built some virtualizations and models
with the data.
