## Web scraping
I scraped [cars.com](https://www.cars.com) by writing
[web_scraping.ipynb](/web_scraping.ipynb) to retreive
car information and saved them in a [csv file](/data/car_info.csv).

## Moduling
The moduling part is done in [this file](/car_price_prediction.ipynb).
I have the data cleaned and have built some modules with the data.
